        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A homemade lasgna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and deliciously cheesy filling. Whereas a more traditional homemade lasgna filling would be made with ricotta cheese this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and parmesan. Served with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine pork and ground beef in alarge, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5-7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring ccasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite. 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F</li>
                    <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
                    <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to cat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5-10 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
